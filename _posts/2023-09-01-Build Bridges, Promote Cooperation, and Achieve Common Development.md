(01 Sep 2023, Nan Jing) Recently, a delegation led by Professor Zhao Yingjie, President of the Singapore Chinese Physicians’ Association and President of the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Dr. Wu Jiasheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, together with the relevant responsible persons of Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution and Singapore Chinese Medicine Private Co., Ltd., visited Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Fengsheng Health College and Fengsheng Holding Group, and held talks at the Fengsheng Five Season Wellness Experience Base.

Established in 1953, the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine has become one of the time-honored, largest, and most well-established TCM education institutions in Southeast Asia after 70 years of development. During the talks, the delegation said that Singapore is actively shifting the focus of the national healthcare system to preventive healthcare, and Chinese medicine is playing an increasingly important role in Singapore’s healthcare system. As China's “cradle of higher TCM education”, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine features an advanced concept of schooling and an international vision of cooperation. The “industry-university-research” cooperation between Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine and Fengsheng, the integrated “teaching, research, inspection, diagnosis, treatment, recuperation, and tourism” in the field of TCM health care, and the Fengsheng Five-Season Wellness Experience Base TCM Practice are of great significance to Singapore. We hope to further enhance cooperation with all parties, strengthen the training of high-level and international TCM talents, and conduct exchanges and cooperation in areas such as the construction of TCM colleges, scientific research, investment in the TCM health industry, and TCM treatment and preventive medical services.

Representatives of Chinese universities and enterprises such as Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Fengsheng Health College, and Fengsheng expressed their hope to strengthen the cooperation and exchanges between Nanjing universities, enterprises, industry organizations, the Singapore Chinese Physicians’ Association and the Singapore College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, pool wisdom of all parties in China and Singapore to facilitate the pace of TCM going global, serve the health and well-being of the people of the two countries, and allow more people worldwide to benefit from the TCM culture.

During the visit, all parties reached many cooperation intentions on projects such as international cooperation in running schools, high-level talent training, TCM clinical and scientific research, comprehensive TCM hospitals and TCM preventive medical services, and TCM non-pharmaceutical therapies.
