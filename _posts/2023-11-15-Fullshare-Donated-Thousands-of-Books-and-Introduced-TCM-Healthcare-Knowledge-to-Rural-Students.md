Focusing on public health, actively participating in community welfare, and implementing health projects beneficial to society have always been crucial aspects of Fullshare Holdings’ core values, and are also key parts of the company’s efforts to implement the ESG strategy, and sustainable development. As a major health enterprise that adheres to the philosophy of creating “healthy employees, healthy enterprise, healthy undertakings, and a healthy society”, Fullshare Holdings has always endeavored to provide high-quality health products and services to society, while actively engaging in various charitable activities, including undertakings that are contributive to environmental protection, rural education, health education, and energy conservation and emission reduction.

The story between Fullshare Holdings and Jinzhai County Huaishuwan Experimental School started in 2018, when the company funded to establish a library for the school, and donated the first batch of 5,000 books to it. Since then, the company has always been trying to do more to enrich the student’s extracurricular life and improve their physical and mental health. As part of that effort, the company recently called its employees to donate idle extracurricular reading materials suitable for primary and secondary school students to bring further diversity to the collections in the library. As a response, books poured from employees across different branches of the company.

Besides books, donations also included body fat scales worth over ten thousand yuan, to let teachers and students better understand their health conditions and nearly ten thousand yuan worth of healthy foods. Additionally, we also invited TCM experts to lecture on TCM health living knowledge to the teachers and students and introduce solutions to deal with common health issues. In the end, volunteers organized the boys and girls to learn TCM body-building exercises, as part of the initiative to introduce TCM health culture into the campus through interesting forms.
