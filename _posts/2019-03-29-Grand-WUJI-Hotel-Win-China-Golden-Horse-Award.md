The China Golden Horse Award is a symbol of industry leadership, one of the highest honors in the global hospitality and tourism industry, and a benchmark for industry development. It was derived from the "Galloping Horse", the symbol of China's excellent tourist cities. Initiated by Mr. Liu Yi, the former Director of China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), as a symbol of industry leadership and one of the highest honors in the global hotel and tourism industry, the award has been described by the media as the "Oscars" of the cultural tourism industry, and the award-winning companies are recognized as monuments to the industry, and the winners are recognized as benchmarks of the industry.
