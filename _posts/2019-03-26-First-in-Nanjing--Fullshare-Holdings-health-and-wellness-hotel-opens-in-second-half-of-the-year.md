In order to build a "Big health ecosystem", Fullshare Holdings is integrating the resources of health experts, Chinese medicine practitioners and Gongfu masters from renowned Chinese medicine colleges, recreational institutions, health complexes and other partners on the "service side". Fullshare Holdings is committed to promoting traditional health and wellness culture and providing a series of health and wellness services such as "travel, medical, meridian, gong and food". At the "channel end", Fullshare Holdings, together with other OTA platforms such as Tuniu and Lvmama who has huge high-quality user traffic, has brought a wide range of tourism products to consumers; At the "product end", Fullshare Holdings is vigorously developing a series of green, natural and pesticide-free healthy food products to provide a wide range of practical and well-matched choices for travel and sports, enhancing the happiness and comfort of consumers in these scenarios. At the "resource end", Fullshare Holdings has set up various offline bases in many provinces and cities in China and overseas regions such as Australia and Singapore, through the revitalization and creation of high-quality tourist destinations, cultural and tourism towns, health complexes and holiday bases, Fullshare can bring more satisfying tourism resources to global users. As one of the offline bases, Grand WUJI Hotel has become a space for users to experience various "big health life scenarios". 

Through the four ends of service, product, resource and channel, Fullshare Holdings provides health services covering a wide range of scenarios, and improves people's quality of life by continuously optimizing its business model, which is what Fullshare Holdings has been focusing since its establishment. This is what Fullshare Holdings has been pursuing since its inception. 

**Proper method to meet the "Triple 1s" consumer demand **

Travel at least once a year, eat healthily at least once a month and exercise at least once a week...... For most consumers, the "Triple 1s" have become the basic requirements for a healthy lifestyle. Fullshare Holdings has been working on the health, travel, sports and food industries to meet the needs of the "3 1s" and to promote consumer upgrades through various empowerment initiatives. 

In the tourism industry, Fullshare Holdings has adopted a dual-track approach of combining light and heavy assets, unlike the development strategy of online travel platforms such as Ctrip and Fliggy and traditional travel agencies such as CCT and CYTS. In terms of heavy assets, Fullshare Holdings has set up many offline resources around the world, such as developing tourism, business and pension industries in many cities in China as well as in countries along the "Belt and Road" like Australia and Singapore, investing in or participating in the operation of the Sheraton Mirage Resort, the Laguna Tourism Tourism Town, Whisper Bay Resort Base and the Laguna Travel Complex in Australia. In terms of light assets, the real estate business model of "construction + finance + operation" has become mature, and the company has also cooperated with a number of domestic online tourism platforms to develop tourism supply chain and tourism finance businesses. The company also plans to build a price comparison platform of luxury hotels, providing consumers with choices of "saving money, saving preparations, saving time and saving trouble" while opening up supporting services such as sightseeing, car rental, food and sports to bring consumers a wide range of preferred services. Fullshare has also planed to cover more than 200 five-star hotels annually from now on.  

In order to promote public fitness, Fullshare Holdings plans to launch a health and exercise aggregation platform, based on the principle of sharing economy, to bring all kinds of unused and underutilized resources such as sports instructors, stadiums and gyms online and match them to fitness enthusiasts in need. 

Whether online or offline, asset light or heavy, Fullshare Holdings is reshaping the big health industry on a macro-level. As a company which provides platform, Fullshare Holdings will fully integrate global health resources, new energy, equipment manufacturing resources, and cultural tourism resources to create a win-win-win healthy life value chain for customers, partners and Fullshare through more extensive and in-depth synergies.
