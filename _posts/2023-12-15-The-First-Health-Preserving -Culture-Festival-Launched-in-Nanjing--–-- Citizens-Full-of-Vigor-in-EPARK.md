The Five Seasons Health-Preserving Culture Festival is Nanjing’s first-ever large-scale health-preserving festival co-sponsored by Fullshare Holding, Fullshare Health College at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (NUCM) and EPARK. This festival aims to “develop a strong five seasons health-preserving culture and promote a healthy lifestyle among people”, and involves a series of activities centered on winter season and hoarding for winter, with the goal of “conserving physical strength, nourishing mental health, preserving vigor and keeping a joyful heart”.

At the cultural experience event named “Little Traditional Chinese Pharmacist”, children wearing traditional Chinese clothes were taught how to weigh and dispense medicines, learnt about traditional Chinese medicines, experienced the making of traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, and felt and inherited the charm of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) culture. To enable citizens to more accurately locate their favorite projects and brands, EPARK rolled out the “Pump Up Your Strength Health-Preserving Map”, making it easier for citizens to find and experience various kinds of health-preserving culture projects.

Also, the Five Seasons Health-Preserving Culture Festival has achieved interconnected development of multiple points and brands by breaking the spacial barrier. During the festival, the TCM Outpatient Clinic of NUCM has also invited well-known TCM physicians to conduct voluntary diagnosis and treatment activities, where consumers can ask them about the way of taking herbal extracts in winter, the health-preserving knowledge and the prevention and treatment of common diseases. The Five Seasons Intelligent TCM Clinic launched the event of “combining the AI intelligent system and inteligent pulse diagnosis hardware with the TCM diagnosis and treatment”, and joined its hands with Nanjing Tongrentang and other brands to release several medicine and food homologous products. The Five Seasons Garden Restaurant reproduced dozens of healthy, cultural and delicious health-preserving dishes by referring to the Garden Food Recipes, a food culture encyclopedia written by Qing Dynasty scholar Yuan Mei over three hundred years ago, bringing a suprising taste experience to food lovers. NUCM Jinxinglou Health-Preserving Hotel offers a unique health-preserving food experience to food lovers for a healthier diet by using seasonal and medicine & food homologous ingredients in the catering business. As one of the most health-preserving rehabilitation and recuperation bases in Nanjing, the Five Seasons Hyatt Hotel not only provides creative health-preserving Huaiyang cuisine based on the concept of medicine food homology, but also offers TCM services (including fitness workouts, moxibustion, massage and special meridian exercises), as well as all kinds of emotional health preserving events, such as tea ceremony, Qin, sutra copying, Tai Chi and herbal extracts.
