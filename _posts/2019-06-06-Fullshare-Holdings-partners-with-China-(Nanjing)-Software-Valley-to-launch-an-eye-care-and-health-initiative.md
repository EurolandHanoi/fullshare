What should I do if I often feel eyestrain? What kind of eyewash is suitable for you when you go to the pharmacy? How can I solve my dry eyes after staring at a screen for a long time? Can I have laser myopia surgery if I am nearsighted with 8.0 diopters? What kind of contact lenses is a better choice for office workers? What is the cause of blurred vision at night? Are anti-blue light lenses really necessary? What is the impact of different light sources on vision ...... To address people's general concern about eye health, ophthalmologists, nursing staff, prescription technicians and health experts at the public service event were on hand to answer questions, provide free testing and diagnosis and offer suggestions for solutions for the general public and corporate employees.
