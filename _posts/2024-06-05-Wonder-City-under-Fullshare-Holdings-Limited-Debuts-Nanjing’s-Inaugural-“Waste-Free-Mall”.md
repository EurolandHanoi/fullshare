How does Wonder City create a “waste-free mall”? When walking into the mall, it can be seen from the mall entrance that the electronic screens at the elevator entrance loop public service announcements on waste reduction, while conservation messages adorn every corner, fostering an environment-conscious atmosphere.

“Since inception, Wonder City has maintained rigorous garbage sorting standards, supervised by dedicated staff who monitor and guide the process. We collaborate with specialized waste sorting, transportation and treatment firms to ensure compliance.

Store kitchen emissions are stringently managed; purification equipment is meticulously selected at the pre-renovation stage, with regular environmental checks conducted jointly with authorities”, Yuan Bin, General Manager of Nanjing FengYue Commercial Management Co., Ltd., explained that each mall floor features designated recycling rooms in public areas, backed by a dedicated maintenance team. Wastewater undergoes central grease trap treatment before meeting discharge standards.
