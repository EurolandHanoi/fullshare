In 2010, Fullshare cooperated with Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and established the "Fullshare Health College of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine", which was inaugurated by Wang Guoqiang, former Vice Minister of Health and Director of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. This is the first and only health college in China that integrates traditional medicine and non-pharmaceutical therapy with health care personnel training, technology research and development, project incubation, and industry-university-research. In 2017, the Fullshare Health College became the first in admitting undergraduate students major in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Health Care in China. In June 2022, these students graduated successfully, becoming the first group of qualified personnel in the Chinese TCM health care and treatment industry. Up to now, Fullshare Health College has trained nearly 2,800 TCM health professionals for the community, making it a well-known window for school-enterprise cooperation for TCM health professionals in China. At the conference, the relevant person in charge of the College said that the revitalisation of TCM and the development of the health care industry require professional, high-level TCM health care and rehabilitation professionals. The school-enterprise cooperation with Fullshare will help accelerate the cultivation of talents, especially applied talents, for the academic education of "treating the potential diseases" and provide high-level talents for the Chinese medicine and health service industry in China. We hope that the two sides will cooperate further and work together to promote the training of TCM talents, technological research, cultural dissemination and industrial incubation.
