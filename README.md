**Jekyllized Story** is a Franken-theme created mostly from HTML5 UP's [Story](https://html5up.net/story) with a drawer menu and blog layout from [Phantom](https://html5up.net/phantom), and a custom header menu. Much of the Jekyllization is based on [andrewbanchich's Jekyllized Phantom Theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/phantom-jekyll-theme).

# Highlights:
- Extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS.
- An interactive demo homepage.
