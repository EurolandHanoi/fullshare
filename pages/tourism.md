It is the first high-end hotel in Nanjing that features the inheritance of traditional Chinese health culture and practices the concept of a healthy lifestyle. </p>
    <p>Four enclosed structures make up the hotel's main structure, which cleverly combines the traditional Chinese conception of health and wellness with the natural ecology. The main building, which shockingly gives the illusion of floating in the air, houses  272 sets of varied guest rooms and suites, in addition to 4 high-end restaurants. The hotel restaurants follow the slogan "tasting five flavors in five seasons, serving only seasonal food," with the goal of serving guests food that can heal their bodies and souls. A 3,000 square meter banquet area, which is made up of banquet rooms and an inner court lawn, can be flexibly divided and combined to meet the needs of meetings and wedding banquets of various sizes and styles. </p>

    <p>Located in Nanjing, the ancient capital, the hotel is run on the principle of fostering a healthy lifestyle by drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese culture and according to the natural laws and health preservation concepts of the five seasons, which go as follows: "growing in spring, blossoming in summer, harvesting in autumn, and relaxing in winter." The goal of the hotel is to provide guests with " a habitat for their body and soul, heaven for their self-cultivation”. </p>
